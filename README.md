# Kenya COVID-19 Dashboard Project
## Overview
COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has affected millions of lives and livelihoods around the world. In Kenya, the government and the public health authorities have been working hard to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate its impacts. However, there is still a need for reliable and accessible information on the COVID-19 situation in the country, especially for the general public, the media, the researchers, and the policymakers.

This project aims to address this need by creating a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides timely and crucial insights into the COVID-19 situation in Kenya. The dashboard leverages the power of MySQL and Tableau to collect, manage, analyze, and visualize the COVID-19 data in Kenya. The dashboard offers real-time data on key COVID-19 metrics, such as new active cases, new confirmed cases, new deaths, and recoveries. The dashboard also provides various visualizations of the data, such as charts, maps, and tables, to help the user understand the trends, patterns, and impacts of the pandemic at different levels of granularity, such as national, county, and sub-county.

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Demonstrate my proficiency in using MySQL and Tableau for data management and analysis, such as querying, joining, filtering, aggregating, and transforming data.
- Apply data visualization techniques to present the data in an effective and engaging way, such as choosing appropriate chart types, colors, labels, and annotations.
- Showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills in designing a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience.

## Data Source
The data source for this project is a public dataset of COVID-19 cases in Kenya that is updated daily by the Ministry of Health. The dataset contains information about the date, location, gender, age, and status of each case. The dataset can be accessed from the following link: [MoH-Kenya COVID-19 Data](https://www.health.go.ke/covid-19-data/).

## Tools and Visualization
The tools used for this project are:

- **Excel**: Excel was used to perform some preliminary data cleaning and formatting, such as removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, and converting data types.
- **MySQL**: MySQL was used to create a database and import the data from Excel. MySQL was also used to perform some data manipulation and analysis, such as creating views, joining tables, filtering data, and aggregating data.
- **Tableau**: Tableau was used to connect to the MySQL database and create various visualizations of the data, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and tables. Tableau was also used to create a dashboard that combines the different visualizations and allows the user to interact with the data, such as filtering, sorting, and drilling down.

The visualization created for this project is a Tableau dashboard that consists of the following components:

- **Title**: The title of the dashboard is "Kenya COVID-19 Dashboard Project" and it includes the name of the author and the date of the last update.
- **Header**: The header of the dashboard contains four key COVID-19 metrics: new active cases, new confirmed cases, new deaths, and recoveries. Each metric is displayed as a number and a percentage change from the previous day. The header also contains a filter that allows the user to select a specific date or a range of dates to view the data.
- **Bar Chart**: The bar chart of the dashboard shows the top 10 counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Kenya. The bar chart uses different colors to indicate the status of the cases, such as active, recovered, or deceased. The bar chart also allows the user to hover over a bar to see more details, such as the name, the number of cases, and the percentage of the total cases. The bar chart also allows the user to click on a bar to filter the data for that county and see the corresponding changes in the other visualizations.
- **Line Chart**: The line chart of the dashboard shows the trend of the COVID-19 cases in Kenya over time. The line chart uses different colors to indicate the status of the cases, such as active, confirmed, recovered, or deceased. The line chart also allows the user to hover over a point to see more details, such as the date, the number of cases, and the percentage change from the previous day. The line chart also allows the user to zoom in or out to see the data at different time intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
- **Pie Chart**: The pie chart of the dashboard shows the distribution of the COVID-19 cases in Kenya by gender. The pie chart uses different colors to indicate the gender of the cases, such as male or female. The pie chart also allows the user to hover over a slice to see more details, such as the name, the number of cases, and the percentage of the total cases.
- **Table**: The table of the dashboard shows the detailed information of the COVID-19 cases in Kenya by date, location, gender, age, and status. The table allows the user to sort the data by any column, such as ascending or descending order. The table also allows the user to search for a specific value, such as a date, a county, or a status.

The dashboard can be viewed and interacted with on Tableau Public using the following link: [Kenya COVID-19 Dashboard Project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/your_name#!/vizhome/KenyaCOVID-19DashboardProject/Dashboard).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how MySQL and Tableau can be used to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides timely and crucial insights into the COVID-19 situation in Kenya. The dashboard offers real-time data on key COVID-19 metrics, such as new active cases, new confirmed cases, new deaths, and recoveries. The dashboard also provides various visualizations of the data, such as charts, maps, and tables, to help the user understand the trends, patterns, and impacts of the pandemic at different levels of granularity, such as national, county, and sub-county. The dashboard also showcases my creativity and problem-solving skills in designing a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience.
